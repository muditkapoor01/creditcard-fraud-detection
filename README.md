# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project analyzes credit card transactions to detect fraudulent activities using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify fraud cases and help minimize financial losses.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle:  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## How to Run


1. Download the `creditcard.csv` dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.  
2. Install required Python libraries:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Key Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

### Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

### Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KMeans Clustering)

### Data Analysis and Feature Engineering

## Summary of Findings
The dataset is highly imbalanced with very few fraud cases.

Data preprocessing and feature scaling improved model performance.

Random Forest classifier achieved high accuracy and recall in detecting fraudulent transactions.

Visualization techniques helped identify patterns and key features contributing to fraud detection.

## Business Value
Detecting credit card fraud effectively helps protect customers and financial institutions, reducing losses and maintaining trust.
