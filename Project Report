# 🛡️ Credit Card Fraud Detection

**By: \[Your Name]**
**Tools Used:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 🔍 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to **detect fraudulent credit card transactions** using machine learning models. Given the extreme class imbalance in the dataset (only 0.17% fraudulent), the focus was on recall and ROC AUC rather than plain accuracy.

---

## ❗ 2. Problem Statement

Financial fraud costs billions every year. Accurately identifying fraudulent transactions, especially in real time, is a major challenge. The objective here was to develop a model that can **detect fraud with high precision and recall**, minimizing false negatives and false positives.

---

## 📊 3. Dataset Description

* **Source:** [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
* **Size:** 284,807 transactions
* **Features:** 30 anonymized PCA components (V1–V28), `Time`, `Amount`, and `Class`
* **Target Variable:**

  * `Class = 0`: Non-Fraud
  * `Class = 1`: Fraud

> 📌 Fraudulent transactions: **492** (\~0.17%)
> 📌 Non-fraudulent transactions: **284,315**

---

## 🧹 4. Data Preprocessing

* Checked for **missing values** – none found.
* Normalized the `Amount` and `Time` features.
* Addressed class imbalance through **stratified splitting** (no oversampling used).
* Feature scaling was applied where necessary for Logistic Regression.

---

## 📈 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* **Class Imbalance:** Heavily skewed towards non-fraud.
* **Correlation:** PCA-transformed features have no direct interpretability, but V14, V10, and V12 showed stronger association with fraud.
* **Distribution of Amounts:** Fraud transactions tend to have smaller amounts on average.

## 🤖 6. Model Building & Evaluation

### ✅ Logistic Regression

| Metric    | Class 0 | Class 1  |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| Precision | 1.00    | **0.83** |
| Recall    | 1.00    | **0.63** |
| F1-Score  | 1.00    | **0.72** |

* **Accuracy:** \~100%
* **Confusion Matrix:**

  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  56851 & 13 \\
  36 & 62 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
* **ROC AUC Score:** **0.958**

**Interpretation:**

* Precision for fraud = 0.83 → 83% of predicted frauds were correct.
* Recall for fraud = 0.63 → Detected 63% of actual frauds.
* F1-score = 0.72 → Good balance between precision and recall.
* High accuracy is expected due to class imbalance.

### 🌲 Random Forest Classifier

| Metric    | Class 0 | Class 1  |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| Precision | 1.00    | **0.94** |
| Recall    | 1.00    | **0.81** |
| F1-Score  | 1.00    | **0.87** |

* **Confusion Matrix:**

  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  56859 & 5 \\
  19 & 79 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
* **ROC AUC Score:** **0.958**

**Interpretation:**

* Improved **recall** compared to Logistic Regression (81% vs. 63%)
* Lower **false negatives**: critical in fraud detection
* Balanced performance makes Random Forest better suited

---

## 📊 7. Visual Insights (optional if you had visuals)

* Heatmap of correlation matrix showed strong independence between features.
* Precision-Recall curve illustrated Random Forest's higher recall.
* Confusion matrices visualized model misclassifications.

## 🧠 8. Model Comparison

| Model               | Precision (Class 1) | Recall (Class 1) | F1-Score (Class 1) | ROC AUC |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.83                | 0.63             | 0.72               | 0.958   |
| Random Forest       | **0.94**            | **0.81**         | **0.87**           | 0.958   |

> ✅ **Random Forest** outperformed Logistic Regression, especially in recall — the most important metric in fraud detection.

---

## 🧾 9. Summary

* Dataset was highly imbalanced (fraud = 0.17%)
* No missing values; clean and ready-to-use
* Logistic Regression offered a baseline
* Random Forest showed **superior performance**, especially in detecting fraudulent cases (high recall)
* ROC AUC for both models > 0.95 → strong overall classifiers

---

## 🚀 10. Future Work

* Use **SMOTE** or **ADASYN** to handle class imbalance via oversampling
* Try **XGBoost** or **LightGBM** for boosting performance
* Deploy model as a **REST API** or real-time fraud detection system
* Add **transaction history** or **user-based features** for better context
